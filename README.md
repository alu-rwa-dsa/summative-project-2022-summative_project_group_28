#ONLINE TICKET-BOOKING SYSTEM
Simple software designed to help users book bus tickets online

##GENERAL INFO

As our group, we developed a CLI software that will help people to book tickets online. The reason why we chose to design this system, is because we consider transportation an important aspect of the development of a country. With the problem of people having to stand in long queues in the bus stations in order to get tickets leading to some leaving without getting their tickets even though they travelled a long way to get to the bus station, we decided to come up with a system that will help people save time and money.  We wanted to be of help to our community, and be able to introduce this system to transportation agencies, especially the ones that transport people from Kigali to rural areas. Our effort will have an impact across the country, particularly on those who travel to Kigali via public transportation from the regions. The transportation and technology sectors will be affected by this initiative.
